# Linear Regression:
Creating this model to teach myself linear regression since it is a fundamental concept in both data science and machine learning, and to begin using the scikit-learn and numpy python libraries. Linear regression provides a solid foundation for understanding data and making predictions. My next step is to find data train my model (This is currently a work in progress).

## Overview:
My script is simple and written for a straightforward scenario with one feature. 
+ Import Libraries: We use numpy for array manipulation, LinearRegression from scikit-learn for modeling, and matplotlib for plotting.
+ Data: X is the feature matrix, and y is the target vector.
+ Create Model: LinearRegression() initializes the linear regression model.
+ Fit Model: model.fit(X, y) trains the model using the provided data.
+ Predict: model.predict(X) generates predictions based on the fitted model.
+ Print Results: Displays the intercept and coefficient of the fitted line.
+ Plot: Shows the data points and the fitted line using matplotlib.
